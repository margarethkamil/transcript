Welcome to the speech.
To the speech recognition test.
In this case I'm using the base model, mine.
So, my name is Margaret and today I will show you a real-time transcription tool.
This tool is uses whisper AI as speech detects text model in Python it listens to.
Listen to live audio, write down what is said instantly. and uses voice activity detection to?
To make the transcription more accurate.
The goal is to show how well it can transcribe its write a speech in real time with fewer mistakes.
This is the process.
Take in consideration. that I'm not a native speaker, right?
Right? Please.
Nice bye.
